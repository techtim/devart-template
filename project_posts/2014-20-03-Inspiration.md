Searching ideas for club intallation, inspiration came after watching Sergey Prokofiev's lamp, that has form of icosahedron with simple white LED strips mounted inside. It has 75cm height and was looking unusual, with mathematical beauty and simplicity. Idea moved forward to create big version of it, so people can travel through it and light can interact and focus on visitors inside its area.
