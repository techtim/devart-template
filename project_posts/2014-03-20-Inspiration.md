## Inspiration

Looking for new ideas for a club installation, inspiration finally came when I saw Sergey Prokofiev's lamp that has a form of icosahedron with simple white LED strips mounted inside. It is 75cm height and looks very unusual with its mathematical beauty and simplicity. The idea developed into creation of a big version of it - people can travel through it and light can interact and focus on the visitors inside its area.
