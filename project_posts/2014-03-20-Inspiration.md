## Lamp

Looking for new ideas for a club installation, inspiration finally came when I saw Sergey Prokofiev's lamp that has a form of icosahedron with simple white LED strips mounted inside. It is 75cm height and looks very unusual with its mathematical beauty and simplicity. 

## Dance
Searching for additional information about icosahedron I found that Rudolf von Laban's (1879-1958) famous dance notation (1926) is based on the icosahedron. The idea of using the icosahedron as the scaffolding of the kinesphere in practicing movement arose spontaneously from the study of movement and dance and is based on the inherent laws of natural movement, which gradually came to light in Laban's professional activity as a dancer and dance-teacher. The object illustrates Laban's theory of space harmony in which clusters of atoms are bound together by simple forces that create an unusual stability when the cluster has the exact number of atoms needed to form a regular icosahedron.

And mine idea developed into creation of a big version of Icosahedron lamp - people can travel and dance through it and light can interact and focus on the visitors inside its area.
