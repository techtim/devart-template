Construction tall and wide enough to allow several people easily come inside and move through it's space. Dynamic and controllable light source that can respond to environment out and inside the object. Interaction with visitors position and sound. To diffuse light and hide dots from LED there must be satin plexiglass over strips. To add more visual illusions 3 othe sides edgeshould be covered with mirroring cover. After many  thoughts about realisation, was understood few things. First, size of one edge should be at least 2 meters long, that gives inscribed sphere diameter near 2*1.51 = 3 meters and diameter of circumscribed sphere 2*1.9=3.8 meters. Second, to contol light with details and integrity there is need for addressable LED strips as light source. Third, there is also need for simulation of scenes in 3D to grab state of edges from modeled scene, because it's impossile to convet icosahedron to 2D, draw animation, grab edges and keep integrity. Tryed to draw simple plane moving from up till down of icosahedron on paper model and didn't get even close.
