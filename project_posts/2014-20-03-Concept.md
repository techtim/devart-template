The installations heights and width must be enough to allow several people to come inside easily and to move through its space. There must be a dynamic and controllable light source that can respond to environment out and inside the object and create interaction with visitors' position and sound. To diffuse light and hide typical for LED dots there must be a satin plexiglass cover over strips. To add more visual illusions, 3 other edge sides should be covered with mirror surface. After a lot of thoughts about the realization, the following things were understood.
Firstly, the size of one edge should be at least 2 meters long that gives diameter of the inscribed sphere near 2*1.51 = 3 meters and diameter of circumscribed sphere 2*1.9=3.8 meters. 
Secondly, to control light with details and integrity there is a need for addressable LED strips as a light source. 
Thirdly, there is also a need for simulating the scene in 3D to grab a state of edges from modeled scene, because it's impossible to convert icosahedron into 2D, draw animation, grab edges and keep integrity. Try to draw simple plane moving from up till down on icosahedron paper model and then glue it and you'll see.
