Construction tall and wide enough to allow several people easily come inside and move through it's space. Dynamic and controllable light source that can respond to environment out and inside the object: interaction with visitors position and sound. To diffuse light and hide dots from LED there must be satin plexiglass over strips. To add more visual illusions 3 other edge sides should be covered with mirroring surface. After many thoughts about realisation, was understood few things. First, size of one edge should be at least 2 meters long, that gives inscribed sphere diameter near 2*1.51 = 3 meters and diameter of circumscribed sphere 2*1.9=3.8 meters. Second, to control light with details and integrity there is need for addressable LED strips as light source. Third, there is also need to simulate scene in 3D to grab state of edges from modeled scene, because it's impossible to convert icosahedron to 2D, draw animation, grab edges and keep integrity. Tried to draw simple plane moving from up till down of icosahedron on paper model and didn't get even close beyond edges of one vertex and it's edges.
