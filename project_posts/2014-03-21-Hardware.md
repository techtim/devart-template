Aluminium was chosen as the main material of installation because of its light weight and strength. Found tubes with right dimension had a rectangle form with the width bigger than the height, so we could place LED strips inside, closing them on the sides with the composite material and on the top with the satin plexiglass. It was decided to make 2,5 meters long edged because of the fact that supplied tubes and LED strips are sold in 5 meter rolls.

The hardest part was vertex welding, it took really a lot of time and even one finger of welder (
Because of the low budget, they were constructed from separate alum parts, not from one piece of aluminium.

When vertices were done and tested, happened that they are fitting too tightly. Vertices were polished to more pyramidal shape.
Composite material and plexiglass was sent to milling after additional measurements.
